	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are few data describing clonidine population pharmacokinetics in children (0-15 years) despite common use. Current pediatric data, described in terms of elimination half-life or C(max) and T(max), poorly explain variability in drug responses among individuals representative of those in whom the drug will be used clinically.
METHODS: Published data from four studies investigating clonidine PK after intravenous (i.v.), rectal and epidural administration (n = 42) were combined with an open-label study undertaken to examine the pharmacokinetics of i.v. clonidine 1-2 microg x kg(-1) bolus in children after cardiac surgery (n = 41). A population pharmacokinetic analysis of clonidine time-concentration profiles (380 observations) was undertaken using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Estimates were standardized to a 70-kg adult using allometric size models.
RESULTS: Children had a mean age of 4 (sd 3.6 years, range 1 week-14 years) years and weight 17.8 (sd 12.6, range 2.8-60) kg. A two compartment disposition model with first-order elimination was superior to a one compartment model. Population parameter estimates (between subject variability) were clearance (CL) 14.6 (CV 35.1\%) l x h(-1 )70 kg(-1), central volume of distribution (V1) 62.5 (71.1\%) l 70 kg(-1), intercompartment clearance (Q) 157 (77.3\%) l x h(-1) 70 kg(-1) and peripheral volume of distribution (V2) 119 (22.9\%) l 70 kg(-1). Clearance at birth was 3.8 l x h(-1) 70 kg(-1) and matured with a half-time of 25.7 weeks to reach 82\% adult rate by 1 year of age. The volumes of distribution, but not clearance, were increased after cardiac surgery (V1 123\%, V2 126\%). There was a lag time of 2.3 (CV 73.2\%) min before absorption began in the rectum. The absorption half-life from the epidural space was slower than that from the rectum (0.98 CV 24.5\% h vs 0.26 CV 32.3\% h). The relative bioavailability of epidural and rectal clonidine was unity (F = 1).
CONCLUSIONS: Clearance in neonates is approximately one-third that described in adults, consistent with immature elimination pathways. Maintenance dosing, which is a function of clearance, should be reduced in neonates and infants when using a target concentration approach.},

	abstract = {Assessing between-study variability in the context of conventional random-effects meta-analysis is notoriously diffcult when incorporating data from only a small number of historical studies. In order to borrow strength, historical and current data are often assumed to be fully homogeneous, but this can have drastic consequences for power and Type I error if the historical information is biased. In this paper, we propose empirical and fully Bayesian modifications of the commensurate prior model (Hobbs et al. 2011) extending Pocock (1976), and evaluate their frequentist and Bayesian properties for incorporating patient-level historical data using general and generalized linear mixed regression models. Our proposed commensurate prior models lead to preposterior admissible estimators that facilitate alternative bias-variance trade-offs than those offered by pre-existing methodologies for incorporating historical data from a small number of historical studies. We also provide a sample analysis of a colon cancer trial comparing time-to-disease progression using a Weibull regression model.},
